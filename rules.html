        The goal of this multi player dice game is to get the most points. There are 5 rounds of the game:
        <br>
        <br>
        1- S
        <br>
        2- N
        <br>
        3- A
        <br>
        4- K
        <br>
        5- E
        <br>
        <br>
        For each round, the current player rolls the dice.
        <br>
        <br>
        If current player rolls any combination that doesn't include a
        'snake eye' (a single pip on the die i.e. a die face with a value of one) they count their current points, and
        have the option to keep rolling, or end their turn ('Hold') and pass the dice to the next player.
        <br>
        <br>
        If their roll includes a single snake eye, the player will collect ZERO points for that round and must pass the
        dice to the next player.
        <br>
        <br>
        If
        their roll includes double snake eyes, the player will lose ALL accumulated points and must pass the dice to the
        next
        player.
        <br>
        <br>
        The player with the most points on the
        5th
        round wins.
